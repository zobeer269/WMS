# WMS

This project is a simple warehouse management system built with Flask and SQLite.

## Initialize the database

After cloning the repository you need to create the SQLite database. Run the following command from the project root:

```bash
python database.py
```

This will create `inventory.db` and seed default roles, permissions and an initial admin user.
